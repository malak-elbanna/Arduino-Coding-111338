This project is entirely based on taking advantage of the wastewater produced by high water-consuming industries (e.g., textiles and paper). The technique is to convert the kinetic energy of the running water to electrical energy by using a hydro Pelton turbine. Pelton turbines can achieve up to 95% efficiency, and even microscale systems can achieve up to 90% peak efficiency. The generated electricity is used to supply other systems and save energy, whether to use it in the air-conditioning devices inside the factory (such as fans), the indoor rooms, or even the outdoors (streets, etc.). These techniques are regulated by the communication system control unit, which is the Arduino UNO. The communication system relies on three types of sensors: movement detecting sensor (Ultrasonic), temperature detecting sensors (LM-35), and light detecting sensor (LDR).

I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project for my senior year capstone project, especially because I expanded my software and hardware knowledge by dealing with different types of sensors. The communication system is connected to a mobile application to help the user control the functions easily.
